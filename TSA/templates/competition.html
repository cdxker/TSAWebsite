  <h1>2018-2019 TSA Competitons</h1> 
  <p>Imagine an activity so captivating that your students spend hours working on it for weeks at a time. That is what can happen when TSA members engage in TSA competitions. Only TSA members have the opportunity to compete at exciting state conferences and then at the annual National TSA Conference. Expert judging by technology and engineering educators and industry representatives inspires the best from participants. Members are rewarded not only with medals or trophies, but also with memories of the camaraderie and the challenge of participating in a National TSA Conference. TSA competitions include categories such as Biotechnology Design, Career Prep, Coding, Digital Photography, Dragster Design, Flight, Leadership Strategies, Medical Technology, Prepared Presentation, Software Development, Technology Problem Solving, Video Game Design, Webmaster, and much more.</p>
